In a program, write a method that accepts two arguments: an array and a number n. Assume that the array contains integers. The method should display all of the numbers in the array that are greater than the number n.




Complete <strong>Programming Challenge #5 Larger Than n </strong>on Page 487. You will have one java file that contains:

<ul>

 <li>a <strong>main</strong>method</li>

 <li>a <strong>largerThanN</strong></li>

</ul>

Demonstrate your <strong>largerThanN</strong> method inside the main method with sample data.

Add javadoc and comments to your code.  Be sure your code is formatted with proper indentation.  Submit your one .java file here.
